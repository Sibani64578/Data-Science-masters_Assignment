    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties in its cost function. It is designed to address some of the limitations of Lasso and Ridge Regression and provide a more robust approach to linear regression, particularly in situations where there are many features or where some features are highly correlated."

    "Choosing the optimal values for the regularization parameters in Elastic Net Regression typically involves a process called hyperparameter tuning. The two main hyperparameters in Elastic Net are \"alpha\" and \"lambda\" (or \"alpha\" and \"rho\"), which control the strength of regularization and the trade-off between L1 and L2 regularization, respectively.
